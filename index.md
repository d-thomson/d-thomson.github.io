## What is this?
This is a mini-course aimed towards recent Computer Science graduates seeking careers in the software engineering field. It is currently under development by [Daniel Thomson](https://github.com/d-thomson) as a final project for the CS 6460 Spring 2019 semester.

## Course Structure
This course consists of four topics: source control, continuous integration, debugging and testing, and databases. Each topic will consist of four sub-components or modules. The first will be an introduction on the topic, what it is and what it is used for in the industry. Next will be a tutorial on the topic. Third will be a real-world example. This will contain a problem and a solution for the student to attempt themselves and learn from. Finally, common tips, tricks and interview questions on the topic.

## Purpose
The goal of this course is to learn skills, tools and concepts that are common in the software development industry however are missing during a Computer Science undergraduate program. Each topic will be introduced with an exlpanation on why it is important, a quick tutorial, a worked example followed by useful tips and interview trivia.
