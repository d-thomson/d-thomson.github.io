# Databases

## Introduction
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. A database could be as simple as a text file with a list of names. Or it could be as complex as a large, relational database management system, complete with in-built tools to help you maintain the data. In this lesson, we will be focusing on Database Management Systems and SQL.

A Database Management System (DBMS), is a software program that enables the creation and management of databases. Generally, these databases will be more complex than the text file/spreadsheet example in the previous lesson. In fact, most of today's database systems are referred to as a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), because of their ability to store related data across multiple tables.

Data is retrieved, modified or created from a database using a domain specific langauge called SQL, or Structure Query Language. It is particularly useful in handling structured data where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data.

## Tutorial
To interact with a database, we need to learn SQL. This tutorial will cover the basics of SQL.
